# fileserver.conf

# Puppet automatically serves PLUGINS and FILES FROM MODULES: anything in
# <module name>/files/<file name> is available to authenticated nodes at
# puppet:///modules/<module name>/<file name>. You do not need to edit this
# file to enable this.

# MOUNT POINTS

# If you need to serve files from a directory that is NOT in a module,
# you must create a static mount point in this file:
#
# [extra_files]
#   path /etc/puppet/files
#   allow *
#
# In the example above, anything in /etc/puppet/files/<file name> would be
# available to authenticated nodes at puppet:///extra_files/<file name>.
#
# Mount points may also use three placeholders as part of their path:
#
# %H - The node's certname.
# %h - The portion of the node's certname before the first dot. (Usually the
#      node's short hostname.)
# %d - The portion of the node's certname after the first dot. (Usually the
#      node's domain name.)

# PERMISSIONS

# Every static mount point should have an `allow *` line; setting more
# granular permissions in this file is deprecated. Instead, you can
# control file access in auth.conf by controlling the
# /file_metadata/<mount point> and /file_content/<mount point> paths:
#
# path ~ ^/file_(metadata|content)/extra_files/
# auth yes
# allow /^(.+)\.example\.com$/
# allow_ip 192.168.100.0/24
#
# If added to auth.conf BEFORE the "path /file" rule, the rule above
# will add stricter restrictions to the extra_files mount point.
